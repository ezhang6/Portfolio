This is one of the projects that I completed during my internship at BC Cancer.

Goal of this report is to assist the breast cancer screening program, to identity what should be the correct procedure for each cancer patient
in a specific months. So that the team can correct it in the database.

*I can only provide screen shots of the report, as I'm not allowed to share the real report itself.*

All the current_imaging/biopsy/pathology are the current chosen procedure for each patient in the BC Cancer database.
All the expected_imaging/biopsy/pathology are what should be chosen for each patient in the BC Cancer database. 

How it works: 
  The breast cancer screening program team will run my report, if they see discrepancies between the "current" and "expected" columns, they will 
  update it in the main database.
  
- Notice that some values are replaced with dummy values, due to privacy.
